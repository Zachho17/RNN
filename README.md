# Time Series Analysis using Recurrent Neural Network in Tensorflow
More writeup about this project will be available later. This project derived from the content being shared in the below article. Instead of data from Yahoo finance on stocks, I used data from Reuters on a FX pair (USDSGD) instead.

I intend to explore further with the architecture in RNN, and to potentially derive some trading strategies with the methodology. This will be particularly helpful when the upcoming Trump administration, where volatility is expected to remain high. Algo or high frequency trading (or even medium frequency in that matter) might be more useful in capturing the volatility than a human could. Stay tune if you like to see more of this content.
